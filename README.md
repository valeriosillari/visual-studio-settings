# Visual-studio Settings

My Personal Visual studio settings

## How to use

If you use Visual Code as editor, add the folder **.vscode** and its file into the root of your repo.

The file **settings.json** will overwrite the Visual Code Editor Options, so here you can set your custom options.

## Info about this file and y options

My settings are based on [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

At file save all files will be handled by Prettier.

So you should set Prettier on your repo to use it in the right way.
